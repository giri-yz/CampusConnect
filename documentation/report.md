\# CampusConnect Vulnerability Lab – Project Documentation



\## 1. Introduction

CampusConnect Vulnerability Lab is a deliberately vulnerable full-stack web

application developed to demonstrate real-world web security vulnerabilities.

The project is inspired by DVWA-style security labs and is designed strictly

for academic and learning purposes.



---



\## 2. Objective

The main objective of this project is:

\- To understand OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities

\- To design a vulnerable web application

\- To demonstrate live exploitation on localhost

\- To understand the importance of secure coding
